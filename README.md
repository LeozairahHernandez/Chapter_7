# Adding Animation to an App
In this chapter, I learned how to bring animations into Flutter apps, aiming to make the user experience more engaging by effectively showing actions. I focused on two types of animations offered by Flutter: physics-based and Tween animations, with an emphasis on Tween animations here. Tween animations work by having a clear start and end point, along with a timeline and a curve that controls how the animation unfolds in terms of timing and speed. This makes it easier to create smooth transitions since the Flutter framework handles the in-between frames automatically. AnimatedContainer it allows for smooth changes in properties such as color, height, width, and decoration over a set duration. It’s quite user-friendly and helps in visually signaling changes in state through animations. AnimatedCrossFade: you can transition smoothly between two child widgets, fading one out while fading the other in over a specific duration. It’s great for switching between views in an attractive manner. AnimatedOpacity: It gradually changes how visible a widget is by adjusting its opacity. It works wonderfully for smoothly showing or hiding item. AnimationController: It gives you more control for crafting custom animations, especially when you want to build more complicated animations with detailed control over how long they last, when they start, stop, or repeat. Staggered Animations: let you run multiple animations one after the other or with slight delays, creating interesting effects.
Finally, it’s important to use animations wisely to boost user experience without overwhelming users.
